# Resistor-Color-Code-or-Value-Detector-from-Image

A resistor is an electrical component that implements resistance as a circuit element. So, identifying the value of resistance from the color codes of resistors is very important. Calculating the resistance manually is very time consuming; in case of complex circuits, it becomes even more troublesome.

So, we have used MATLAB for a faster solution for calculating values of multiple resistors, regardless of how they are placed. Our project emphasizes on taking resistor pictures as inputs and calculates the values of given resistors. Our purpose was to use MATLAB programs to detect the color bands of resistors, find out the sequence of the bands and calculate the resistance values using the color bands. 

We have also built a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to make the program user friendly. Using this GUI, users can easily select the desired picture as input and the program will detect the resistors in the picture, calculate its color codes and show both the image and the value of all the resistors separately as output. Our objective for this project was to work on image processing and use image processing tools to detect the color bands of resistors and calculate the values for output without even needing to input the color codes manually for each resistor.
